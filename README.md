# Agriculture ML Project ðŸŒ±

This project is my final assignment for MFT (Mojtama Fani Tehran), where I used Python and machine learning to predict crop yield and soil quality using agricultural and climate data.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Real climate data from NASA POWER API (JSON format)
- Neural Network built using Keras (ReLU, Linear, Softmax)
- GUI for user-friendly prediction
- Achieved strong performance on both regression and classification tasks
